# Question 2
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer
The **differences** between `.then` and `.catch` are that:

`.then` is used to handle the fulfillment of a promise, which occurs when the `resolve()` function is called. It is for successful promise resolutions and allows us to specify what should happen after.

`.catch` is used to handle the rejection of a promise, which occurs when the `reject()` function is called. It is specifically a mechanism for handling errors, enabling us to specify what actions to take in such scenarios.

`.then` will execute if `resolve()` was invoked, while `.catch` will execute if `reject()` was invoked.

Now, the **similarities** between the two is that both `.then` and `.catch` return new promises, facilitating promise chaining. Also, they are both methods that schedule callbacks to be executed when the promise settles (either resolved or rejected).

In addition, `.then()` can take two arguments: a success handler and an error handler. If an error handler is provided as the second argument, it can catch errors from both the promise itself and the success handler. Errors in a `.then()` chain will propagate to the nearest `.catch()`, providing a consistent error-handling mechanism.
