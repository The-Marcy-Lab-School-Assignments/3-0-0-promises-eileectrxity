# Question 3
With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling *and* returning them

# Answer
In the promise statement `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, a new promise is created, taking in a function as an argument. Of the two options provided, option a, calling `resolve()` or `rejected()`, is the one that will make the promise produce a value. Option b isn't correct because returning the calls is not necessary; calling them will already trigger the promise resolution, producing our desired value.
