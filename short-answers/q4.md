# Question 4
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
With the provided promise statement, the arguments passed into resolve/reject define how/when the promise resolves or rejects. We can think of resolve() and reject() as the decision-makers of the promise. When you call `resolve()`, you're essentially saying, 'Success, everything went well.' The value you pass into `resolve()` becomes the data your promise was waiting for and signifies fulfillment.

On the other hand, `reject()` is like saying, 'Error, something went wrong.' Whatever you pass into `reject()` becomes the reason why your promise couldn't deliver on its initial goal. So, the arguments you pass into `resolve()` and `reject()` are like the scriptwriters of your promise's storyline. They define the conditions for success or failure and ultimately shape how your promise resolves or rejects.
